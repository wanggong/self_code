A plaintext searching program using the knuth-morris-pratt pattern matching algorithm
(See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuth-Morris-Pratt_algorithm)

Usage ./kmp.exe -flags pattern file

Flags:
   -m : continue searching the file after a match is found
Returns: the first line in the file containing the specified pattern

UPDATE 1
- added the -m flag
- fixed an improper memory deallocation

For serious usage consider using grep (packaged with most if not all linux distros)
